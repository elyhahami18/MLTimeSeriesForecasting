# MLTimeSeriesForecasting
Stock Price Prediction (NVDA) with Python/Machine Learning. I used Yahoo Finance API to get real-time stock price data (start, low, high, end, volume, etc.) to predict the stock price of high-rising NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ: NVDA), modeled the historic data with a Candlestick graph, and then used Automatic Time Series (python autots library) to create a model and forecast the stock price for the next 10 days. The model is trained on the stock's historic data from 17 June 2022 to 17 June 2023 (365 days) and predicts the price from 19 June 2023 to 30 June 2023.
